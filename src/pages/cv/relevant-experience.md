### Relevant experience

As a developer and data journalist, I have planned and produced analysis, tools, workflows and editorial systems for several public-interest investigative data stories at the CBC, Globe and Mail, and Winnipeg Free Press. 

Projects include investigations into environmental accidents (Canadian pipeline & rail incidents), missing and murdered Indigenous women, healthcare metrics, police responses to sexual assault victims (Unfounded), the real estate economy, and the influence of organized crime in civil society (Connected). 

Those stories have affected policy and practice, been recognized nationally and internationally, and received some of the most prestigious awards in journalism including:

• *Unfounded* Michener Award (2018), McGillivray Award and Data Journalism Award - Canadian Association of Journalists (2017), Data Journalism Awards - Global Editors Network (2017), Al Neuharth Innovation in Investigative Journalism Award (2017)

• *Missing & Murdered*: Don McGillivray Award for investigative journalism - Canadian Association of Journalists (2016), Canadian Hillman Prize (2016)

• *A Killer High: Fentanyl’s deadly path*: Open Media - Canadian Association of Journalists (2016)

• *Rate my hospital*: Media Award for Health Reporting - Canadian Medical Association - (2014), Canadian Screen Awards (2014)

• *Pipeline incidents*: Best Interactive Feature - Ryerson Review of Journalism (2013), Online Media - Canadian Association of Journalists (2013)

Using a combination of programming languages, databases, geographic information systems (GIS), along with assorted utilities and cloud services, I have planned and deployed newsroom tools and related training for co-workers and summer students in several newsrooms and organizations. Those tools include responsive chart and table generators, editorial style guides, data verification systems and R packages to scaffold investigative data analysis projects in the newsroom. 

Past projects have acquired data through a combination of web-scraping, federal and provincial FOI requests, collaboration with researchers, and commercial products. Rarely in machine-readable formats, data has typically required extraction, cleaning and validation. For larger scale stories, and those with higher impact liability potential, I have built several internal web tools to handle data verification and vetting as part of the analysis workflow.

Where applicable, and in support of the story and reader, published journalistic works include interactive and exploratory elements including searchable databases, APIs, interactive visualizations, and static graphics highlighting key statistical insights.
